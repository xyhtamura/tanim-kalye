            <p class="artist-name"><a href="https://xyhtamura.github.io/">Xyh Tamura</a></p>
			<p class="collaborators">with input and collaboration from Krus na Ligas residents: Brisa Amir, Delle A. Castillo ·  Krus na Ligas Barangay Officials: former Barangay Captain Julian B. Santos, Barangay Secretary Jonathan C. Sombrero · UP Institute of Biology: Jayson A. Mansibang, The Jose Vera Santos Memorial Herbarium · Carinderia Sefali</p>

        <section class="intro">
            <p>Tanim-Kalye is a new media research-art and poetry installation that reimagines the street map of Krus na Ligas as a living plant assemblage. Roads are recreated using color-inverted images of flora significant to the community’s history and ecology. A work of community co-creation, this piece was developed through consultation with Krus na Ligas residents, its local governing unit, and botanists from the UP Institute of Biology.</p>
			<p>The project began with the name Krus na Ligas itself, which references a cross-shaped Ligas tree that once grew in the area. The artwork transforms the roads of Krus na Ligas into ghostly, surreal forms that evoke botanical specimens and x-rays. Rendered in a cyanotype-like style and fragmented into glyphs, the maps are suspended on acetate over a window at Carinderia Sefali. This allows sunlight or the restaurant's lights to illuminate them like lightboxes. A bundle of them are stacked on each other, so the glyphs layer on each other to form the map of Krus na Ligas's roads, which can be flipped through. The blue backgrounds also reference the protective talismans of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cultures, imbuing the maps with a magical, protective function.</p>
            <!--<p>The project began with the name Krus na Ligas itself, which references a cross-shaped Ligas tree that once grew in the area. In my own work relating to non-human existence, I began thinking about the botanical layer of Krus na Ligas, which also has its own history relating to plants and agriculture. I've also lived in Quezon City for a long time, in the Tandang Sora area and been a UP Student, so my experience of Quezon City is a forested feeling, which I wanted to talk about. Since the theme of the Quezon City Biennial was Ilalim/Ibabaw, which talked about transport systems and the over/under dynamic, I thought to link this idea to the streets of Krus na Ligas, turning them into plants. I rendered them in an electric, cyanotype-like style and fragmented them into glyphs. the maps are suspended on acetate over a window at Carinderia Sefali. This allows sunlight or the restaurant's lights to illuminate them like lightboxes. The deep blue backgrounds also reference the protective talismans of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cultures, imbuing the maps with a magical, protective function.</p>-->
            <p>This piece is part of the exhibit “Ang Paglaho ng Bagong Mundo sa mga Araw ng Nakaraan“ for the 2025 Quezon City Biennial, which explores the theme of Ilalim/Ibabaw (Under/Over) as a metaphor for the city's layered urban experience.</p>

            <h2>The Installation: Three Series</h2>
            <p>The work is presented in three distinct series, each printed on acetate sheets that invite interaction.</p>
            
            <h3>A Map with Poetry</h3>
			<img src="flippable.jpg" style="width:33%;">
            <p>This series consists of three superimposed layers that form a partial map of Krus na Ligas and a complete/fragmentable poem. Viewers can flip through the acetates, reading poetic fragments on each page, and three crucial plants:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Diliman Fern: A blue map with red accents, representing the area's native flora, an one of the possible namesakes of the Diliman area.</li>
                <li>The Ligas Tree: A pink/red map, nodding to both the tree's poisonous nature and Richard Mosse’s infrared photography of war, connecting it to the Katipuneros' history.</li>
                <li>Rice: A green map, referencing Krus na Ligas’ past as vital farmland.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Alternate Names</h3>
			<img src="darker.jpg" style="width:33%;">
            <p>This series mirrors the main series with a dark background, making the flora appear to glow through light. Street names appear in altered spellings, wordplay, including Tadbalik (Tagalog syllabic reversal), turning color inversion into linguistic inversion. This can be seen as an alternate universe version of Krus na Ligas, with the wordplay referencing various aspects of Krus na Ligas's culture, present and past. The streets that the plants represent can be deduced from this series.</p>

            <h3>Lost Plants & Community Voices</h3>
			<img src="quotes.jpg" style="width:33%;">
            <p>This series maps the remaining streets using three overlooked or now missing plants in Krus na Ligas's history: the Mulberry (Morus alba), Pungapong (Amorphophallus paeoniifolius), and Pongamia (Pongamia merrillii). Each piece pairs a plant with a direct textual fragment from an interview conducted during the research process, enjambed poetically.</p>

            <h2>Research as Art and Performance</h2>
            <p>The research process itself was an artistic act. By working directly with community members, officials, and academics, the project blurred the lines between artist, author, and participant. They were active collaborators who shaped the work with their expertise and lived experience.</p>
            <p>The act of inquiry became a performance, creating social situations, such as residents exploring their own lineage, that would not have otherwise occurred. In this sense, the research generated its own intangible artwork, transforming knowledge-gathering into an act of ontological play and community connection.</p>
